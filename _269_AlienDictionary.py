"""
Loop statements may have an else clause; it is executed when the loop 
terminates through exhaustion of the iterable (with for) or when the 
condition becomes false (with while), but not when the loop is terminated 
by a break statement. This is exemplified by the following loop, which 
searches for prime numbers:

>>> for n in range(2, 10):
...     for x in range(2, n):
...         if n % x == 0:
...             print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)
...             break
...     else:
...         # loop fell through without finding a factor
...         print(n, 'is a prime number')
...
2 is a prime number
3 is a prime number
4 equals 2 * 2
5 is a prime number
6 equals 2 * 3
7 is a prime number
8 equals 2 * 4
9 equals 3 * 3
